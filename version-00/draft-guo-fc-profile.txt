               A Profile for Forwarding Commitments (FCs)
                      draft-guo-fc-profile-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) protected
   content type for Forwarding Commitments (FCs) objects used in
   Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).  An FC is a digitally
   signed object that provides a means of verifying whether an IP
   address block is received from AS a to AS b and announced from AS b
   to AS c.  When validated, an FC's eContent can be used for the
   detection and mitigation of route hijacking, especially providing
   protection for the AS_PATH attribute in BGP-UPDATE.

1.  Introduction

   The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [RFC4271] was designed with no
   mechanisms to validate the security of BGP attributes.  There are two
   types of BGP security issues, BGP Hijacks and BGP Route Leaks
   [RFC7908], plagues Internet security.

   The primary purpose of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)
   is to improve routing security.  (See [RFC6480] for more
   information.)  As part of this system, a mechanism is needed to allow
   entities to verify that an IP address holder has permitted an AS to
   advertise a route along the propagation path.  A Forwarding
   Commitment (FC) provides this function.

   A Forwarding Commitment (FC) is a digitally signed object through
   which the issuer (the holder of an Autonomous System identifier), can
   authorize one or more other Autonomous Systems (ASes) as its upstream
   ASes or one or more other ASes as its downstream ASes.  The upstream
   ASes, or previous ASes, means that the issuer AS can receive BGP
   route updates from these ASes.  The downstream ASes, or nexthop ASes,
   means that the issuer AS would advertise the BGP route to these ASes.

   In this propagation model, it uses a Web of Trust, i.e., the issuer
   AS trusts its previous ASes and authorizes nexthop ASes to propagate
   its received routes.  Then, all nexthop ASes would also accept the
   routes and proceed to send them to their next hops.  The relationship
   among them is the signed FC, which attests that a downstream AS has
   been selected by the directly linked upstream AS to announce the
   routes.

   Initially, all ASes on the propagation path should sign one or more
   FCs independently if it wants to propagate the route to its
   downstream ASes, and then be able to detect and filter malicious
   routes (e.g., route leaks and route hijacks).  In addition, the FC
   can also attest that all ASes on a propagation path have received and
   selected this AS_PATH, which can be certified as a trusted path.

   The FC uses the template for RPKI digitally signed objects [RFC6488]
   for the definition of a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [RFC5652]
   wrapper for the FC content as well as a generic validation procedure
   for RPKI signed objects.  As RPKI certificates issued by the current
   infrastructure are required to validate FC, we assume the mandatory-
   to-implement algorithms in [RFC6485] or its successor.

   To complete the specification of the FC (see Section 4 of [RFC6488]),
   this document defines:

   1.  The object identifier (OID) that identifies the FC-signed object.
       This OID appears in the eContentType field of the
       encapContentInfo object as well as the content-type signed
       attribute within the signerInfo structure.

   2.  The ASN.1 syntax for the FC content, which is the payload signed
       by the BGP speaker.  The FC content is encoded using the ASN.1
       [X.680] Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) [X.690].

   3.  The steps required to validate an FC beyond the validation steps
       specified in [RFC6488].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  The FC Content-Type

   The content-type for an FC is defined as ForwardingCommitment and has
   the numerical value of 1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.(TBD).

   This OID MUST appear both within the eContentType in the
   encapContentInfo object as well as the content-type signed attribute
   in the signerInfo object (see [RFC6488]).

3.  The FC eContent

   The content of an FC identifies a forwarding commitment and
   forwarding binding that an AS announces to other nodes upon receiving
   a BGP-UPDATE message.  Other on-path ASes can validate the FC and
   perform path verification for traffic forwarding based on the AS-path
   information.  Off-path ASes can utilize this FC for collaborative
   filtering.  An FC is an instance of ForwardingCommitmentAttestation,
   formally defined by the following ASN.1 [X.680] module:

   RPKI-FC-2025
     { iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1)
        pkcs-9(9) smime(16) modules(0) id-mod-rpki-FC-2025(TBD) }

   DEFINITIONS EXPLICIT TAGS ::=

   IMPORTS
     CONTENT-TYPE
     FROM CryptographicMessageSyntax-2010 -- RFC 6268
       { iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1)
         pkcs-9(9) smime(16) modules(0) id-mod-cms-2009(58) } ;

       nexthopASes         SEQUENCE (SIZE(1..N)) OF ASID,

       prefixLength        INTEGER (SIZE(0..128)}

   AFI ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE(2))

   IPAddress ::= BIT STRING (SIZE(0..128))

   ForwardingCommitment ::= SEQUENCE {
       id                  BIT STRING
       signature           BIT STRING }

   END

                   Figure 1: eContent of FC signed object

   Note that this content appears as the eContent within the
   encapContentInfo (see [RFC6488]).

3.1.  version

   The version number of the ForwardingCommitmentAttestation MUST be 0.

3.2.  asid

   The asid field contains the AS number of the issuer AS associated
   with this FC.

3.3.  previousASes

   The previousASes field contains the upstream ASes' number of the
   issuer AS that can advertise the prefixes to the issuer AS.

3.4.  nexthopASes

   The nexthopASes field contains the downstream ASes' number of the
   issuer AS that can receive advertised routes from the issuer AS.

3.5.  Type Prefix

   Within the Prefix structure, the prefixes field encodes the set of IP
   address prefixes announced by the issuer AS in AS_PATH.  The prefixes
   field can be blank which means that all traffic received from
   upstream ASes defined in previousASes field could be advertised to
   downstream ASes defined in nexthopASes field.

3.5.1.  Element afi

   Within the Prefix structure, afi contains the Address Family
   Identifier of an IP address family.  This specification only supports
   IPv4 and IPv6.  Therefore, afi MUST be either 0001 or 0002.

3.5.2.  Element address

   The address field contains the IP address.

3.5.3.  Element prefixLength

   The prefixLength field contains the length of the IP address prefix.

3.6.  Type ForwardingCommitment

   Within the ForwardingCommitment structure, the fc field encodes the
   forwarding commitment generated by this AS and will be validated by
   other AS.

3.6.1.  Element id

   The id field contains the hash of the current AS-path in the
   associated BGP-UPDATE plus the next hop AS and above prefix filed.

3.6.2.  Element signature

   The signature field is a signature signed by the BGP speaker who
   issues this FC.

4.  FC Validation

   Only when finished the validation of the FC object will a relying
   party sign a new FC to announce a trusted and selected routing
   announcement.  To validate an FC, the relying party MUST perform all
   the validation checks specified in [RFC6488] as well as the following
   additional FC-specific validation step.

   *  The IP Address Delegation extension [RFC3779] is present in the
      end-entity (EE) certificate (contained within the FC), and the IP
      address prefix in the FC payload is contained within the set of IP
      addresses specified by the EE certificate's IP Address Delegation
      extension.

   *  The EE certificate's IP Address Delegation extension MUST NOT
      contain "inherit" elements described in [RFC3779].

   *  The Autonomous System Identifier Delegation Extension described in
      [RFC3779] is also used in Forwarding Commitment and MUST be
      present in the EE certificate.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC6480], [RFC6481], [RFC6485],
   [RFC6487] and [RFC6488] also apply to FCs.
